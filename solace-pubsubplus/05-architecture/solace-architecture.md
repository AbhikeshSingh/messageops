## ðŸš€ Solace PubSub+ Architecture

This document explains the core architecture of Solace PubSub+ and how it supports fast, reliable messaging for modern applications.

## ðŸ§© Core Components

- **Brokers:** The heart of the system, brokers route messages between publishers and subscribers, ensuring messages reach the right destination quickly.
- **Topics:** Logical channels that organize messages. Publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers receive messages from them.
- **Queues:** Temporary storage areas for messages to ensure delivery even when subscribers are offline or busy.
- **Bridges:** Connect multiple brokers across different data centers or cloud regions for scalability and fault tolerance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Principles

- **Decoupling:** Publishers and subscribers donâ€™t need to know about each other, reducing dependencies and improving system flexibility.
- **Event-driven Design:** Systems respond to events in real-time, enabling efficient and reactive architectures.
- **High Availability:** Clustering and replication features ensure continuous uptime and message durability.
- **Scalability:** Brokers can be added or scaled out as message volumes grow without impacting performance.

## Deployment Options

Solace can be deployed on-premises, in public or private clouds, or as containers, giving you flexibility based on your environment and needs.

Understanding this architecture helps design messaging platforms that are reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain.
