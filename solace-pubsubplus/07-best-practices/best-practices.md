# Best Practices for Solace PubSub+ Platforms

Follow these guidelines to build and maintain a robust, secure, and high-performing Solace messaging environment.

## Design and Architecture

- **Topic Hierarchy:** Plan a clear and logical topic structure to simplify management and subscription patterns.
- **Message Size:** Keep message payloads as small as practical to improve throughput and reduce latency.
- **Redundancy:** Use broker clustering and network bridges to eliminate single points of failure.

## Security

- **Encryption:** Enable TLS for all client and broker communications to protect data in transit.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Use strong authentication methods (e.g., OAuth, LDAP) and fine-grained access control.
- **Audit Logging:** Keep detailed logs of client activities and system events for compliance and troubleshooting.

## Monitoring and Alerting

- **Health Metrics:** Continuously monitor broker CPU, memory, disk usage, and network throughput.
- **Alerts:** Set up alerts for key thresholds and failures to respond quickly.
- **Log Aggregation:** Use centralized logging solutions to correlate events and speed up root cause analysis.

## Operations and Maintenance

- **Backups:** Regularly back up configurations and persistent message stores.
- **Automation:** Use scripts or automation tools for routine tasks like patching, scaling, and failover testing.
- **Documentation:** Maintain runbooks and operational guides for onboarding and incident response.

Implementing these best practices helps you maximize uptime, security, and performance of your messaging platform.
